I'm a data scientist who likes to build products utilizing AI, ML tools. I have end-to-end experience in building ML products starting from data collection, data cleaning, feature engineering and selection, model building and deployment. Also, I have built products utilizing visualization softwares like Tableau and Domo.   

**Competition experience**:
1. WiDS Datathon 2020 (kaggle): Top 14% 
2. Pover-T Tests: Predicting Poverty (drivendata): Top 17%
3. Santander Customer Transaction Prediction(kaggle): Top 20% 
4. Sustainable Industry: Rinse Over Run (drivendata): Top 21%

**Open-source contribution**:<br>
[Feature Engine](https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine)
1. ```DropConstantFeatures()```: Drops constant and quasi-constant features from a dataframe. It works for both numerical and categorical variables. sklearn implementation ```VarianceThreshold``` only support numerical features.  
2. ```DropDuplicateFeatures()```: Drop duplicate features from a dataframe.
