I'm a data scientist who likes to build products utilizing AI, ML tools. I have end-to-end experience in building ML products starting from data collection, data cleaning, feature engineering and selection, model building and deployment. Also, I have built products utilizing visualization softwares like Tableau and Domo.   

I have also contributed to open source packages like [Feature Engine](https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine) where I contributed two capabilities:

1. DropConstantFeatures(): Drops constant and quasi-constant features from a dataframe. It works for both numerical and categorical variables. sklearn implementation ```VarianceThreshold``` only support numerical features.  
2. DropDuplicateFeatures(): Drop duplicate features from a dataframe.
