A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. For example: Age, Gender, Income, Country etc.

1. **Numerical Variables**: Variables whose values are numbers <br> <br>
    
    1.1. **Discrete Variables**: A variable whose values are whole numbers(counts) is called Discrete variable. For example: Number of children in family, Number of pets in family etc
    
    1.2. **Continuous Variables**: A variable that contains any value within some range is called Continuous variable. For example: Total amount paid by customer, House Price, time spend surfing website etc.

2. **Categorical Variables**: Variables whose values are selected from a group of categories, also called labels. For example: Gender, Marital Status etc. <br> <br>
   
    2.1. **Ordinal Variables**:Ordinal Variables are those variables in which categories are meaningfully ordered. For example: Days of week etc. <br><br>
    2.2. **Nominal Variables**: **There is no intrinsic order of labels**. For example: Post Code, Country, etc. <br><br>
    2.3. **Binary Variable**: Variable which can take only two values. For example: True/False, 0/1

3. **Date and Time Variables**: <br>
    3.1. Date Only <br>
    3.2. Time Only <br>
    3.3. Date and Time <br>

4. **Mixed Variables** : Variables that contain numbers and categories in values<br>

    4.1. Number or labels in different observation <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Number of Credit Account => [1-100, U, T, M] where U=Unknown, T=Unverified, M=Unmatched <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Number of missed payments => [1-3, D, A] where D=Defaulted, A=Arrangements <br>

    4.2. Number and labels in same observation. For example, Cabin(Ticket), ticket number(TItanic), Vehicle Registration, etc...
